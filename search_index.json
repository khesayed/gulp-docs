Globs use node-glob syntax except that negation is fully supported.\nA glob that begins with ! excludes matching files from the glob results up to that point. For example, consider this directory structure:\nclient/\n  a.js\n  bob.js\n  bad.js\nThe following expression matches a.js and bad.js:\ngulp.src(['client/*.js', '!client/b*.js', 'client/bad.js'])\noptions\nType: Object\nOptions to pass to node-glob through glob-stream.\ngulp supports all options supported by node-glob and glob-stream except ignore and adds the following options.\noptions.buffer\nType: Boolean\nDefault: true\nSetting this to false will return file.contents as a stream and not buffer files. This is useful when working with large files. Note: Plugins might not implement support for streams.\noptions.read\nType: Boolean\nDefault: true\nSetting this to false will return file.contents as null and not read the file at all.\noptions.base\nType: String\nDefault: everything before a glob starts (see glob2base)\nE.g., consider somefile.js in client/js/somedir:\ngulp.src('client/js/**/*.js') // Matches 'client/js/somedir/somefile.js' and resolves `base` to `client/js/`\n  .pipe(minify())\n  .pipe(gulp.dest('build'));  // Writes 'build/somedir/somefile.js'\n\ngulp.src('client/js/**/*.js', { base: 'client' })\n  .pipe(minify())\n  .pipe(gulp.dest('build'));  // Writes 'build/js/somedir/somefile.js'\n\ngulp.dest(path[, options])\nCan be piped to and it will write files. Re-emits all data passed to it so you can pipe to multiple folders.  Folders that don't exist will be created.\ngulp.src('./client/templates/*.jade')\n  .pipe(jade())\n  .pipe(gulp.dest('./build/templates'))\n  .pipe(minify())\n  .pipe(gulp.dest('./build/minified_templates'));\n\nThe write path is calculated by appending the file relative path to the given\ndestination directory. In turn, relative paths are calculated against the file base.\nSee gulp.src above for more info.\npath\nType: String or Function\nThe path (output folder) to write files to. Or a function that returns it, the function will be provided a vinyl File instance.\noptions\nType: Object\noptions.cwd\nType: String\nDefault: process.cwd()\ncwd for the output folder, only has an effect if provided output folder is relative.\noptions.mode\nType: String\nDefault: 0777\nOctal permission string specifying mode for any folders that need to be created for output folder.\ngulp.task(name [, deps] [, fn])\nDefine a task using Orchestrator.\ngulp.task('somename', function() {\n  // Do stuff\n});\n\nname\nType: String\nThe name of the task. Tasks that you want to run from the command line should not have spaces in them.\ndeps\nType: Array\nAn array of tasks to be executed and completed before your task will run.\ngulp.task('mytask', ['array', 'of', 'task', 'names'], function() {\n  // Do stuff\n});\n\nNote: Are your tasks running before the dependencies are complete?  Make sure your dependency tasks are correctly using the async run hints: take in a callback or return a promise or event stream.\nYou can also omit the function if you only want to run a bundle of dependency tasks:\ngulp.task('build', ['array', 'of', 'task', 'names']);\n\nNote: The tasks will run in parallel (all at once), so don't assume that the tasks will start/finish in order.\nfn\nType: Function\nThe function performs the task's main operations. Generally this takes the form of:\ngulp.task('buildStuff', function() {\n  // Do something that \"builds stuff\"\n  var stream = gulp.src(/*some source path*/)\n  .pipe(somePlugin())\n  .pipe(someOtherPlugin())\n  .pipe(gulp.dest(/*some destination*/));\n\n  return stream;\n  });\n\nAsync task support\nTasks can be made asynchronous if its fn does one of the following:\nAccept a callback\n// run a command in a shell\nvar exec = require('child_process').exec;\ngulp.task('jekyll', function(cb) {\n  // build Jekyll\n  exec('jekyll build', function(err) {\n    if (err) return cb(err); // return error\n    cb(); // finished task\n  });\n});\n\n// use an async result in a pipe\ngulp.task('somename', function(cb) {\n  getFilesAsync(function(err, res) {\n    if (err) return cb(err);\n    var stream = gulp.src(res)\n      .pipe(minify())\n      .pipe(gulp.dest('build'))\n      .on('end', cb);\n  });\n});\n\nReturn a stream\ngulp.task('somename', function() {\n  var stream = gulp.src('client/**/*.js')\n    .pipe(minify())\n    .pipe(gulp.dest('build'));\n  return stream;\n});\n\nReturn a promise\nvar Q = require('q');\n\ngulp.task('somename', function() {\n  var deferred = Q.defer();\n\n  // do async stuff\n  setTimeout(function() {\n    deferred.resolve();\n  }, 1);\n\n  return deferred.promise;\n});\n\nNote: By default, tasks run with maximum concurrency -- e.g. it launches all the tasks at once and waits for nothing. If you want to create a series where tasks run in a particular order, you need to do two things:\n\ngive it a hint to tell it when the task is done,\nand give it a hint that a task depends on completion of another.\n\nFor these examples, let's presume you have two tasks, \"one\" and \"two\" that you specifically want to run in this order:\n\nIn task \"one\" you add a hint to tell it when the task is done.  Either take in a callback and call it when you're\ndone or return a promise or stream that the engine should wait to resolve or end respectively.\n\nIn task \"two\" you add a hint telling the engine that it depends on completion of the first task.\n\n\nSo this example would look like this:\nvar gulp = require('gulp');\n\n// takes in a callback so the engine knows when it'll be done\ngulp.task('one', function(cb) {\n    // do stuff -- async or otherwise\n    cb(err); // if err is not null and not undefined, the run will stop, and note that it failed\n});\n\n// identifies a dependent task must be complete before this one begins\ngulp.task('two', ['one'], function() {\n    // task 'one' is done now\n});\n\ngulp.task('default', ['one', 'two']);\n\ngulp.watch(glob [, opts], tasks) or gulp.watch(glob [, opts, cb])\nWatch files and do something when a file changes. This always returns an EventEmitter that emits change events.\ngulp.watch(glob[, opts], tasks)\nglob\nType: String or Array\nA single glob or array of globs that indicate which files to watch for changes.\nopts\nType: Object\nOptions, that are passed to gaze.\ntasks\nType: Array\nNames of task(s) to run when a file changes, added with gulp.task()\nvar watcher = gulp.watch('js/**/*.js', ['uglify','reload']);\nwatcher.on('change', function(event) {\n  console.log('File ' + event.path + ' was ' + event.type + ', running tasks...');\n});\n\ngulp.watch(glob[, opts, cb])\nglob\nType: String or Array\nA single glob or array of globs that indicate which files to watch for changes.\nopts\nType: Object\nOptions, that are passed to gaze.\ncb(event)\nType: Function\nCallback to be called on each change.\ngulp.watch('js/**/*.js', function(event) {\n  console.log('File ' + event.path + ' was ' + event.type + ', running tasks...');\n});\n\nThe callback will be passed an object, event, that describes the change:\nevent.type\nType: String\nThe type of change that occurred, either added, changed, deleted or renamed.\nevent.path\nType: String\nThe path to the file that triggered the event.\n"},"CLI.html":{"url":"CLI.html","title":"CLI","keywords":"","body":"gulp CLI docs\nFlags\ngulp has very few flags to know about.

You may also provide an optional _flush\nfunction if you need to emit a bit more data at the end of the stream.\nFrom within your transform function call this.push(file) 0 or more times to pass along transformed/cloned files.\nYou don't need to call this.push(file) if you provide all output to the callback() function.\nCall the callback function only when the current file (stream/buffer) is completely consumed.\nIf an error is encountered, pass it as the first argument to the callback, otherwise set it to null.\nIf you have passed all output data to this.push() you can omit the second argument to the callback.\nGenerally, a gulp plugin would update file.contents and then choose to either:\n\ncall callback(null, file)\nor\nmake one call to this.push(file)\n\nIf a plugin creates multiple files from a single input file, it would make multiple calls to this.push() - eg:\nmodule.exports = function() {\n  /**\n   * @this {Transform}\n   */\n  var transform = function(file, encoding, callback) {\n    var files = splitFile(file);\n    this.push(files[0]);\n    this.push(files[1]);\n    callback();\n  };\n\n  return through.obj(transform);\n};\n\nThe gulp-unzip plugin provides a good example of making\nmultiple calls to push().  It also uses a chunk transform stream with a _flush() function within the Vinyl transform function.\nVinyl files can have 3 possible forms for the contents attribute:\n\nStreams\nBuffers\nEmpty (null) - Useful for things like rimraf, clean, where contents is not needed.\n\nA simple example showing how to detect & handle each form is provided below, for a more detailed explanation of each\napproach follow the links above.\nvar PluginError = require('gulp-util').PluginError;\n\n// consts\nvar PLUGIN_NAME = 'gulp-example';\n\nmodule.exports = function() {\n    return through.obj(function(file, encoding, callback) {\n        if (file.isNull()) {\n            // nothing to do\n            return callback(null, file);\n        }\n\n        if (file.isStream()) {\n            // file.contents is a Stream - https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html\n            this.emit('error', new PluginError(PLUGIN_NAME, 'Streams not supported!'));\n\n            // or, if you can handle Streams:\n            //file.contents = file.contents.pipe(...\n            //return callback(null, file);\n        } else if (file.isBuffer()) {\n            // file.contents is a Buffer - https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html\n            this.emit('error', new PluginError(PLUGIN_NAME, 'Buffers not supported!'));\n\n            // or, if you can handle Buffers:\n            //file.contents = ...\n            //return callback(null, file);\n        }\n    });\n};\n\nNote: When looking through the code of other gulp plugins (and the example above), you may notice that the transform functions will return the result of the callback:\nreturn callback(null, file);\n\n...don't be confused - gulp ignores any return value of your transform function.  The code above is simply a short-hand form of:\nif (someCondition) {\n  callback(null, file);\n  return;\n}\n// further execution...\n\nUseful resources\n\nFile object\nPluginError\nevent-stream\nBufferStream\ngulp-util\n\nSample plugins\n\nsindresorhus' gulp plugins\ncontra's gulp plugins\ngulp-replace\n\nAbout streams\nIf you're unfamiliar with streams, you will need to read up on them:\n\nhttps://github.com/substack/stream-handbook (a MUST read)\nhttp://nodejs.org/api/stream.html\n\nOther libraries that are not file manipulating through streams but are made for use with gulp are tagged with the gulpfriendly keyword on npm.\n"},"writing-a-plugin/guidelines.html":{"url":"writing-a-plugin/guidelines.html","title":"Guidelines","keywords":"","body":"Guidelines\n\nWhile these guidelines are totally optional, we HIGHLY recommend that everyone follows them. Nobody wants to use a bad plugin. These guidelines will actually help make your life easier by giving you assurance that your plugin fits well within gulp.\n\nWriting a Plugin > Guidelines\n\nYour plugin should not do something that can be done easily with an existing node module\nFor example: deleting a folder does not need to be a gulp plugin. Use a module like del within a task instead.\nWrapping every possible thing just for the sake of wrapping it will pollute the ecosystem with low quality plugins that don't make sense within the gulp paradigm.\ngulp plugins are for file-based operations! If you find yourself shoehorning a complex process into streams just make a normal node module instead.\nA good example of a gulp plugin would be something like gulp-coffee. The coffee-script module does not work with Vinyl out of the box, so we wrap it to add this functionality and abstract away pain points to make it work well within gulp.\n\n\nYour plugin should only do one thing, and do it well.\nAvoid config options that make your plugin do completely different tasks\nFor example: A JS minification plugin should not have an option that adds a header as well\n\n\nYour plugin shouldn't do things that other plugins are responsible for\nIt should not concat, gulp-concat does that\nIt should not add headers, gulp-header does that\nIt should not add footers, gulp-footer does that\nIf it's a common but optional use case, document that your plugin is often used with another plugin\nMake use of other plugins within your plugin! This reduces the amount of code you have to write and ensures a stable ecosystem.\n\n\nYour plugin must be tested\nTesting a gulp plugin is easy, you don't even need gulp to test it\nLook at other plugins for examples\n\n\nAdd gulpplugin as a keyword in your package.json so you show up on our search\nYour plugin API should be a function that returns a stream\nIf you need to store state somewhere, do it internally\nIf you need to pass state/options between plugins, tack it on the file object\n\n\nDo not throw errors inside a stream\nInstead, you should emit it as an error event.\nIf you encounter an error outside the stream, such as invalid configuration while creating the stream, you may throw it.\n\n\nPrefix any errors with the name of your plugin\nFor example: gulp-replace: Cannot do regexp replace on a stream\nUse gulp-util's PluginError class to make this easy\n\n\nName your plugin appropriately: it should begin with \"gulp-\" if it is a gulp plugin\nIf it is not a gulp plugin, it should not begin with \"gulp-\"\n\n\nThe type of file.contents should always be the same going out as it was when it came in\nIf file.contents is null (non-read) just ignore the file and pass it along\nIf file.contents is a Stream and you don't support that just emit an error\nDo not buffer a stream to shoehorn your plugin to work with streams. This will cause horrible things to happen.\n\n\n\n\nDo not pass the file object downstream until you are done with it\nUse file.clone() when cloning a file or creating a new one based on a file.\nUse modules from our recommended modules page to make your life easier\nDo NOT require gulp as a dependency or peerDependency in your plugin\nUsing gulp to test or automate your plugin workflow is totally cool, just make sure you put it as a devDependency\nRequiring gulp as a dependency of your plugin means that anyone who installs your plugin is also installing a new gulp and its entire dependency tree.\nThere is no reason you should be using gulp within your actual plugin code. If you find yourself doing this open an issue so we can help you out.\n\n\n\nWhy are these guidelines so strict?\ngulp aims to be simple for users. By providing strict guidelines we are able to provide a consistent and high-quality ecosystem for everyone. While this does add a little more work and thought for plugin authors, it removes a lot of problems later down the road.\nWhat happens if I don't follow them?\nnpm is open for everyone, and you are free to make whatever you want but these guidelines were prescribed for a reason. There are acceptance tests coming soon that will be integrated into the plugin search. If you fail to adhere to the plugin guidelines it will be publicly visible/sortable via a scoring system. People will always prefer to use plugins that match \"the gulp way\".\nWhat does a good plugin look like?\n// through2 is a thin wrapper around node transform streams\nvar through = require('through2');\nvar gutil = require('gulp-util');\nvar PluginError = gutil.PluginError;\n\n// Consts\nconst PLUGIN_NAME = 'gulp-prefixer';\n\nfunction prefixStream(prefixText) {\n  var stream = through();\n  stream.write(prefixText);\n  return stream;\n}\n\n// Plugin level function(dealing with files)\nfunction gulpPrefixer(prefixText) {\n\n  if (!prefixText) {\n    throw new PluginError(PLUGIN_NAME, 'Missing prefix text!');\n  }\n  prefixText = new Buffer(prefixText); // allocate ahead of time\n\n  // Creating a stream through which each file will pass\n  return through.obj(function(file, enc, cb) {\n    if (file.isNull()) {\n      // return empty file\n      return cb(null, file);\n    }\n    if (file.isBuffer()) {\n      file.contents = Buffer.concat([prefixText, file.contents]);\n    }\n    if (file.isStream()) {\n      file.contents = file.contents.pipe(prefixStream(prefixText));\n    }\n\n    cb(null, file);\n\n  });\n\n}\n\n// Exporting the plugin main function\nmodule.exports = gulpPrefixer;\n\n"},"writing-a-plugin/using-buffers.html":{"url":"writing-a-plugin/using-buffers.html","title":"Using buffers","keywords":"","body":"Using buffers\n\nHere is some information on creating gulp plugin that manipulates buffers.\n\nWriting a Plugin > Using buffers\nUsing buffers\nIf your plugin is relying on a buffer based library, you will probably choose to base your plugin around file.contents as a buffer.

Splitting out each shared pipeline also gives you one central location to modify if you decide to change up your workflow.\n"},"recipes/specifying-a-cwd.html":{"url":"recipes/specifying-a-cwd.html","title":"Specifying a new cwd (current working directory)","keywords":"","body":"Specifying a new cwd (current working directory)\nThis is helpful for projects using a nested directory structure, such as:\n/project\n  /layer1\n  /layer2\nYou can use the gulp CLI option --cwd.\nFrom the project/ directory:\ngulp --cwd layer1\n\nIf you only need to specify a cwd for a certain glob, you can use the cwd option on a glob-stream:\ngulp.src('./some/dir/**/*.js', { cwd: 'public' });\n\n"},"recipes/split-tasks-across-multiple-files.html":{"url":"recipes/split-tasks-across-multiple-files.html","title":"Split tasks across multiple files","keywords":"","body":"Split tasks across multiple files\nIf your gulpfile.js is starting to grow too large, you can split\nthe tasks into separate files using one of the methods below.\n\nBe advised, that this approach is considered deprecated\nand could lead to problems when migrating to the gulp 4.\n\nUsing gulp-require-tasks\nYou can use the gulp-require-tasks\nmodule to automatically load all your tasks from the individual files.\nPlease see the module's README for up-to-date instructions.\nUsing require-dir\nYou can also use the require-dir module to load your tasks manually.\nImagine the following file structure:\ngulpfile.js\ntasks/\n├── dev.js\n├── release.js\n└── test.js\nInstall the require-dir module:\nnpm install --save-dev require-dir\n\nAdd the following lines to your gulpfile.js file:\nvar requireDir = require('require-dir');\nvar tasks = requireDir('./tasks');\n\n"},"recipes/using-external-config-file.html":{"url":"recipes/using-external-config-file.html","title":"Using external config file","keywords":"","body":"Using external config file\nBeneficial because it's keeping tasks DRY and config.json can be used by another task runner, like grunt.\n-\nconfig.json\n{\n  \"desktop\" : {\n    \"src\" : [\n      \"dev/desktop/js/**/*.js\",\n      \"!dev/desktop/js/vendor/**\"\n    ],\n    \"dest\" : \"build/desktop/js\"\n  },\n  \"mobile\" : {\n    \"src\" : [\n      \"dev/mobile/js/**/*.js\",\n      \"!dev/mobile/js/vendor/**\"\n    ],\n    \"dest\" : \"build/mobile/js\"\n  }\n}\n\n-\ngulpfile.js\n// npm install --save-dev gulp gulp-uglify\nvar gulp = require('gulp');\nvar uglify = require('gulp-uglify');\nvar config = require('./config.json');\n\nfunction doStuff(cfg) {\n  return gulp.src(cfg.src)\n    .pipe(uglify())\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(cfg.dest));\n}\n\ngulp.task('dry', function() {\n  doStuff(config.desktop);\n  doStuff(config.mobile);\n});\n\n"},"recipes/using-multiple-sources-in-one-task.html":{"url":"recipes/using-multiple-sources-in-one-task.html","title":"Using multiple sources in one task","keywords":"","body":"Using multiple sources in one task\n// npm install --save-dev gulp merge-stream\n\nvar gulp = require('gulp');\nvar merge = require('merge-stream');\n\ngulp.task('test', function() {\n  var bootstrap = gulp.src('bootstrap/js/*.js')\n    .pipe(gulp.dest('public/bootstrap'));\n\n  var jquery = gulp.src('jquery.cookie/jquery.cookie.js')\n    .pipe(gulp.dest('public/jquery'));\n\n  return merge(bootstrap, jquery);\n});\n\ngulp.src will emit files in the order they were added:\n```js\n// npm install gulp gulp-concat\nvar gulp = require('gulp');\nvar concat = require('gulp-concat');\ngulp.task('default', function() {\n  return gulp.src(['foo/', 'bar/'])\n    .pipe(concat('result.txt'))\n    .pipe(gulp.dest('build'));\n});\n"},"recipes/browserify-transforms.html":{"url":"recipes/browserify-transforms.html","title":"Browserify + Transforms","keywords":"","body":"Browserify + Transforms\nBrowserify has become an important and indispensable\ntool but requires being wrapped before working well with gulp.
